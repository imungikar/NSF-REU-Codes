to-do:
- I probably need to clean up my runSim file to make sure that all the boundaries and parameters are appropriate and the file will run successfully
- I need to make sure that my file directory is actually clean before I do anything else - that the files are actually saving using an MCP or whatever
- write a script that is able to create an arrangement of 1s and 0s (my CRM) before the arrangeent to Matrix file is able to run successfully
- figure out how exactly this is going to run together (when I just press run to daskRunnerScript, does everything magically just fall into place at that point (?)







questions for Miguel
- go through code step by step
- figure out what this SSHkey process works
- how to pip donwload Dask o all the cade com,p[uters
- clarify with Miguel what the solver conditions actually are






- uptime script complete
- with argparse through masterscript I think I can see how everything is supposed to communicate
- I think I have a pretty good rough idea of how the SSH key thing will work - something I still want to review w Miguel now

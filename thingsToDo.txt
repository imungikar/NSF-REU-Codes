to-do:
- I probably need to clean up my runSim file to make sure that all the boundaries and parameters are appropriate and the file will run successfully
- I need to make sure that my file directory is actually clean before I do anything else - that the files are actually saving using an MCP or whatever
- write a script that is able to create an arrangement of 1s and 0s (my CRM) before the arrangeent to Matrix file is able to run successfully
- figure out how exactly this is going to run together (when I just press run to daskRunnerScript, does everything magically just fall into place at that point (?)







questions for Miguel
- go through code step by step
- figure out what this SSHkey process works
- how to pip donwload Dask o all the cade com,p[uters
- clarify with Miguel what the solver conditions actually are






- uptime script complete
- with argparse through masterscript I think I can see how everything is supposed to communicate
- I think I have a pretty good rough idea of how the SSH key thing will work - something I still want to review w Miguel now





- goals for today now

- store some stuff in scratch directory and keep other stuff intact
- somehow refactorArrGen when put inside the file needs to be able to output the actual matrix and put that into a directory as well (does that macro need to be rewritten in VBA or something)
- gpt run through of potential code compilation




- list of things that need to be included in the CST solver
- I need to put all my solver parameters and everything inside. that will just be part of the histroy list though, so should be all good. 
- I need also to put inside my file a script that calls the array generator (which I should create) and creates the array contingent based on that


done:
- I believe that uptime actually works decently well now
- create a script that can parse through sim_id and losses and create a general aggregate matrix 
- also did some other sutff maybe forgot to record
